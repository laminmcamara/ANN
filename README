# Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Assignment

## Overview
This assignment demonstrates the implementation of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) using two datasets: the Iris dataset and the MNIST dataset. The goal is to build and evaluate ANN models for both structured and image data.

## Datasets
1. **Iris Dataset**: A classic dataset used for classification tasks, containing features of iris flowers and their species.
2. **MNIST Dataset**: A large database of handwritten digits commonly used for training various image processing systems.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `tensorflow`
  - `keras`

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**
   - Clone this repository or download the ZIP file and extract it to your local machine.

2. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - You can install the required libraries using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow keras
     ```

3. **Download the Datasets:**
   - Ensure you have the `iris.csv` file in your working directory. The MNIST dataset will be automatically loaded using TensorFlow Datasets.

## Usage
1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Navigate to the directory containing this project and open the Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```

2. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Open the notebook file (e.g., `ANN_Assignment.ipynb`) and execute each cell sequentially to build and evaluate the ANN models.

3. **Visualizations:**
   - The notebook includes visualizations for model accuracy and samples from the MNIST dataset.

## Model Training and Evaluation
- The Iris dataset model is trained using an ANN with two hidden layers and evaluated for accuracy.
- The MNIST model is trained on a modified dataset of handwritten digits, with results displayed after training.

## Conclusion
This assignment illustrates the capabilities of ANN in handling both structured and image data. It provides insights into model training, evaluation, and the importance of data preprocessing.
